# Welcome to the Bergzeit inventory campaign project documentation! 

## High-level description: What is this repository about?

This repository takes item-level product data and performs SQL transformations to generate bulk uploads formats for specific Google Ads entities such as campains, adgroups, keywords etc.

For a PPC introduction, reference this SMX deck:

This documentation describes all necessary business logic in SQL and configuration in YAML to perform the necessary transformations. All code was written by the Bergzeit Analytics and Performance team, primarily Christopher Gutknecht and Stephanie Hubert. The content includes all data lineage from source to output, the SQL code, column descrition

## Prerequisites: Which skills and tools do I need to implement this inventory campaign framework?

This repository builds on the dbt (data build tool) framework, the industry standard for large scale SQL transformation in modern data warehouses. 

- You need solid working knowledge of SQL (or a data team) to model your data transformation of product item inventory
- For an introduction to the dbt framework, see here: https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-exactly-is-dbt/
- To learn the necessary fundamentals of dbt, see this course: https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals
- To get startetd with dbt cloud (recommended for beginners), see here: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/dbt-cloud-features

For a dbt cloud project, you will need to connect 1) a data warehouse (BigQuery recommended) and 2) a version control system (github recommended)

## Installation: How can I setup inventory-driven PPC campaigns for my project?

This is a step-by-step guide to setup the inventory campaign project for you

1. Have your dbt cloud account setup and connect your datawarehouse. For BigQuery, see here: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup
2. Clone the github repository into your dbt cloud project: https://github.com/ChrisGutknecht/inventory_campaigns

3. Configure you ```dbt_project.yml``` file in the following way: 
- 

4. Review your ```packages.yml``` file. The repo currently leverages ```dbt_utils``` for syntactical abstractions and tests, ```dbt_expectations``` for data quality tests and ```codegen``` for more scalable documentation.

5. 

## Where can I find the REPORT OVERVIEW? (Wo gehts zur ReportÃ¼bersicht?)

Scroll down to exposures and open the *dashboards* folder. There you will find all documented dashboards in Data Studio and PowerBI.

## How is this documentation generated?

The dbt cloud framework provides an *auto-generated* documentation, based on daily jobs. 
The changes to sql, yaml or markdown files are processed through Gitlab versioning, see reference links below.

## Who are the maintainers of this documentation? 

- Stephanie Hubert
- Helena Steurer 
- Christopher Gutknecht

## In which JIRA project is the work being done?

The analytics team uses the ['WEBA' or Data Services](https://bergzeit.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/WEBA/boards/81) project and ticket-based branches to make changes to the repository and documentation.
The ['MEAS' or Measurement](https://bergzeit.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/MEAS/boards/4) also contains some tasks.

Every new developed model should have minimum tests and documentation
